        is a website I developed for myself and other bilingual English and Korean speakers. After entering any combination of emojis to describe your current mood, an artificial intelligence algorithm will return three words each in English and Korean that best encapsulate your mood, and the website will display them alongside their definitions. A closer look at the background images on each page of the website will reveal two different skylines blended into one image, made up of photos I took of Seoul and New York City, representing the two different worlds I seek to reconcile through this piece. I formulated the idea for the website from my personal experiences: often, I find myself failing to find the ideal word to describe certain situations even though I am a native English speaker and fluent in Korean, which is especially frustrating when I struggle to express my emotions. Thus, I turned to my third “language” of code to act as a stronger bridge between my mood and my spoken/written language. The ultimate goal of the website is to slowly develop my vocabulary through consistent usage, as the AI is tuned to return words that are on the more difficult and obscure side. Overall, this part of my project seeks to represent how I have grown to be able to use code not just another medium of expression, but also as a tool to further my proficiency in other mediums (i.e. English and Korean).
